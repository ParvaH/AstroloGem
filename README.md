# AstroloGem
AstroloGem - a strict RAG-based astrologer 

# AstroloGem 💎

AstroloGem is my experiment in building a **strict AI astrologer** — one that uses
*Brihat Jataka* as a **reference**, applies **explicit, auditable rules**, and
**admits when something isn’t defined**.

In short: **Astrology, but engineered.**

This project explores how large language models can be constrained using
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce **structured, explainable,
and ethically bounded outputs**, instead of vague or authoritative claims.

## What AstroloGem Is

- A **strict RAG-based astrology system**
- Grounded in **explicit rule files**, not intuition
- Uses *Brihat Jataka* only as a **canonical reference**, not as executable text
- Designed to say *“this is not defined”* when rules are missing
- Focused on **clarity, consistency, and transparency**

AstroloGem intentionally avoids poetic interpretations, fear-based predictions,
or deterministic claims.

---

## What AstroloGem Is NOT

- ❌ Not an oracle or prediction engine
- ❌ Not a substitute for professional, personal, medical, legal, or life advice
- ❌ Not an authoritative representation of classical astrology
- ❌ Not a system that “believes” or “knows” astrology

This is a **learning and engineering experiment**, not a belief system.

## Architecture Overview

AstroloGem follows a **Strict RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** design:

- **Rules > References**
- Classical texts are *non-executable* unless explicitly mapped to rules
- If a concept is not operationalized, the system must decline to answer
- Outputs are constrained by interpretation and recommendation guardrails

This repository contains:
- Rule files
- Authority hierarchy
- Interpretation constraints
- Sample outputs
- Test prompts

The AI model itself is **not hosted here**.

## How to Use AstroloGem

1. Open the AstroloGem Gemini Gem (linked in this repository)
2. Provide structured birth details as requested
3. Review responses as **guidance**, not conclusions
4. Expect explicit uncertainty where rules do not exist

## Disclaimer ⚠️

This project is created **solely for learning, experimentation, and
demonstration purposes**.

- AstroloGem does **not provide authoritative astrology**
- Outputs should **not be relied upon** for personal, professional,
  legal, medical, or life decisions
- Any interaction, interpretation, or outcome produced by AstroloGem
  **cannot and should not be used against the author**
- Use of this repository or the linked Gem implies acceptance that
  results are **non-binding, non-guaranteed, and experimental**

You are responsible for how you interpret or apply any output.

## Why This Project Exists

AstroloGem exists to explore:
- How AI systems can **respect uncertainty**
- How classical knowledge can be


## AI Assistance

Some portions of this repository, including documentation and example prompts, were drafted with the assistance of AI tools.
